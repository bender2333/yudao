# Beijing Subway Fare Calculation System PRD

## 1. Requirements Overview
This project aims to develop a command-line interface (CLI)-based Beijing Subway fare calculation system, integrating graph theory algorithms with fare calculation functions. The system should support user input of starting and ending stations, calculate the optimal route using Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, and automatically calculate fares according to Beijing Subway fare structure. It should also offer path visualization and multi-format export capabilities, providing passengers with a convenient service for querying subway travel expenses.

## 2. Basic Functional Requirements

- Provide station distance data management, supporting maintenance of adjacency relationships between stations.
- Implement special processing for transfer stations, supporting path computation at multi-line interchange points.

### 2.2 Path Calculation Module
- Integrates Beijing Subway network data (loaded from `subway_data.json` file, including station names, connectivity, distances, etc.)
- Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest path between stations with the following weight factors:
  - Base Weight: Actual inter-station distance (unit: meters)
  - Optimization Factor: Time complexity optimization via priority queue implementation

- Provides various path query functions:
  - Shortest-Distance Path: Minimizing total travel distance
  - Minimum-Transfer Path: Minimizing the number of transfers
  - Comprehensive Optimal Path: Balancing distance and transfers using a composite scoring metric
- Supports configuration of maximum transfer limits and line preference settings (configurable via command-line arguments `--max_transfers` and `--line_preference`)
- Supports special handling of complex transfer stations: Correctly handles path calculation at multi-line interchange points, including special processing for transfer time and distance

### 2.3 Fare Calculation Module
- Implements a fare calculation algorithm based on Beijing Subway fare structure, recognizing the following fare tiers:
  - Basic Tier: 0-6 kilometers (3 yuan)
  - Progressive Tier: 6-12 kilometers (4 yuan), 12-22 kilometers (5 yuan), 22-32 kilometers (6 yuan)
  - Extended Tier: Over 32 kilometers (1 yuan per additional 20 kilometers, e.g., 32-52 kilometers: 7 yuan, 52-72 kilometers: 8 yuan)
- Provides accurate fare conversion based on the calculated distance:
  - Distance-to-fare mapping conversion
  - Special handling of boundary cases: Boundary values themselves are calculated according to the next higher price tier (left-closed, right-open interval rule)
    - 6 kilometers (6000 meters) calculated as 4 yuan (entering 6-12 kilometers tier)
    - 12 kilometers (12000 meters) calculated as 5 yuan (entering 12-22 kilometers tier)
    - 22 kilometers (22000 meters) calculated as 6 yuan (entering 22-32 kilometers tier)
    - 32 kilometers (32000 meters) calculated as 7 yuan (entering extended tier over 32 kilometers)
  - Support for ceiling rounding support for fractional distances

### 2.4 Path Visualization and Export Module
- Implement path visualization based on route information and generate the following content:
  - Complete station sequence (list of station names, displayed in order from start to end)
  - Total distance summary (displayed in both meters and kilometers, using meters for short distances and kilometers for long distances)
  - Transfer details (transfer station identification and all subway line names involved)
  - Computed fare result (formatted as "Fare: X yuan")
- Support generating path reports in various formats:
  - Console-formatted text (including path details and fare information, displaying line segments and transfer stations)
  - Structured data format (JSON format for programmatic integration, containing fields such as query information, path, distance, fare, estimated time, transfer count, involved lines)
- Implement path summary generation, automatically extracting key information:
  - Total travel distance (converted from meters to kilometers)
  - Total fare calculation
  - Number of transfers required
  - Estimated travel time (based on distance and transfer count: approximately 1.5 minutes per kilometer, approximately 5 minutes per transfer)

### 2.5 Command-Line Interface (CLI) System
- Implements a simple command line interface, supporting standard input/output operations
- Provides real-time input validation, including:
  - Station name standardization verification (based on official Beijing Subway station names)
  - Input format validation (supporting "Starting Station; Ending Station" format, using semicolon as separator)
  - Station existence verification (ensuring the entered station exists in the system)
  - Logical validation (e.g., "Starting station cannot be the same as the ending station")
- Supports command-line argument configuration:
  - `--output_file`: Specify output file path, supporting export of query results to file
  - `--format`: Specify output format, supporting `text` (text format) and `json` (JSON format)
  - `--mode`: Specify path query mode, supporting `shortest_distance` (shortest distance), `least_transfer` (minimum transfers), `comprehensive` (comprehensive optimal)
  - `--max_transfers`: Set maximum transfer limit
  - `--line_preference`: Set line preference (e.g., "Line 1")
  - `--check_data`: Execute data integrity check and exit
- Supports continuous query functionality: Automatically enters the next query cycle after completing one query, without requiring program restart
- Supports multi-level error handling mechanisms:
  - Input format error prompt (e.g., "Input format incorrect, please use 'Starting Station; Ending Station' format")
  - Nonexistent station prompt (e.g., "Starting station 'XXX' does not exist, please check the station name")
  - Path calculation exception handling
  - Fare calculation exception handling

### 2.6 Data Management Module
- Supports comprehensive management of Beijing Subway network data, with data source from `subway_data.json` file, including:
  - Station data: station names, numbers, and lines
  - Connection data: adjacent station distances and bidirectional connection relationships
  - Line data: line names, station sequences, and transfer information
